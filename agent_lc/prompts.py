# DeepSeek Cross-Check Prompt Template
DEEPSEEK_CROSS_CHECK_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Compare these analyses and identify genuine gaps:

Log Analysis:
{log_summary}

Screenshot Analysis Summary:
{screenshot_summary}

Please provide a detailed analysis of:
1. Genuine Missing Evidence: List only steps that are truly missing from screenshots, after verifying the actual content of each screenshot
2. Actual Sequence Issues: Note only real sequence mismatches, based on the actual content of screenshots
3. Real Verification Gaps: List only verification steps that are truly missing, after checking the screenshot analysis for verification evidence

Important:
- Check the actual content of each screenshot before declaring it missing
- Don't assume a step is missing just because of the filename
- Look for evidence in the analysis text
- Consider implicit verifications in the screenshots
- Focus on what's genuinely missing, not what might be missing

Example of proper analysis:
BAD: "No screenshots show login screens" (incorrect because we have screenshots showing username field filled)
GOOD: "The login process is partially captured with username entry, but missing the password entry step"

BAD: "No screenshots display the cart page" (incorrect because we have screenshots showing cart contents)
GOOD: "Cart page is captured, but missing the transition from product page to cart page"

Please be this precise in your analysis."""

# DeepSeek Verification Prompt Template
DEEPSEEK_VERIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """Please verify these conclusions against the actual screenshot data:

Conclusions to Verify:
{conclusions}

Screenshot Analysis Summary:
{screenshot_summary}

For each conclusion, verify if it's correct by checking the actual screenshot data.
Format your response as:

VERIFICATION RESULTS:

1. Confirmed Conclusions (with evidence):
   - List conclusions that are accurate with screenshot evidence
   - Include the specific screenshot number/ID where the evidence was found

2. Incorrect Conclusions (with actual evidence):
   - List conclusions that were wrong with screenshot evidence
   - Specify which screenshots were checked and what was actually found
   - If a step is missing, identify between which screenshots it should have occurred

3. Final Summary:
   - List each missing step and specify:
     * Between which screenshots it should have occurred
     * What evidence we have before and after the missing step
     * Any partial evidence of the step being attempted

Be extremely precise and only make claims you can verify with the actual data."""
